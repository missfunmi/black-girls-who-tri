## When and where was your first triathlon?
My first triathlon was the [Chicago SuperSprint](https://www.chicagotriathlon.com/race/supersprint/) in August 2017. It’s a really short race, about half the distance of a [sprint](https://totaltriathlon.com/triathlon-distances) -- I swam 400 yards, biked 6.2 miles, and ran 1.5 miles. It’s an easy, beginner race, and I highly recommend it for anyone curious about the sport. Plus, Chicago is great in the summer!

## Were you nervous about it? What inspired you to sign up?
I decided to sign up for a triathlon because I was in my mid-20s and didn’t know how to swim or ride a bike (I know, crazy!). Learning to ride a bike was easy: it only took me an afternoon. Learning to swim was the real struggle. I barely made progress with group lessons and eventually found success with a 1-on-1 coach. I was still not very confident when August rolled around, but one of my best friends Nnenne completed the race with me, so we just looked out for each other.

## What’s been one of the hardest things about training or racing? What resources do you find helpful in overcoming them?
Training for a triathlon can be time-consuming. It’s a lot more manageable if I plan my week ahead. My training involves 2 - 3 weekly sessions of each sport, so 6 out of 7 days, I’m working out. I aim to go to bed before 11 so I can train in the morning, and I don’t beat myself up if I happen to work late or stay out with friends -- I just adjust the plan. I love reading about [other people’s morning routines](https://mymorningroutine.com) for ideas I can incorporate into my schedule to help me stay on top of it all.

## What have you discovered in your journey as a black, female triathlete?
No box braids until the season is over! Heavy, wet braids are a real pain to deal with. I’ve experimented with different hair styles, and for now, I’m sticking to wigs so I can wash and condition my hair frequently. Additionally, chlorinated water really dries out my skin, particularly on my face, so now I pay extra attention to my moisturizing routine.

I also love running into other black people at races! At many small races, I’m often the only black girl or person in sight, so it’s always awesome when I see another athlete of color. I’ve nodded at a few people on the bike or run leg like, Yeah, I see you!

## Do you think you will keep doing triathlons?
Absolutely. I love this sport, and it’s amazing to think that just two years ago I couldn’t swim to save my life. Now I’m setting goals and smashing them and pushing myself harder than I thought I could.

I also love being part of the triathlon community. Talking to people at races and joining clubs have been great ways to learn new tips and make friends or find people to train or race with. My coach runs a team in New York called [H Body Lab](https://hbodylab.com?referrer=blackgirlswhotri.com), and when I’m in San Francisco, I train with the awesome athletes in [Golden Gate Triathlon Club](https://ggtc.org).
